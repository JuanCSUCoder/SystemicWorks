				<h2>Why SystemicWorks?</h2>
				<p>
					SystemicWorks was made in order to develop an open-source software that can help educative institutions to teach
					about
					systems dynamics modeling and get a better understanding of complex situations, without needing to license a paid
					version of a bussiness software. Nowadays, there are some available solutions with paid licenses, that are intended
					to
					be used in large corporations. However, not all the systems dynamics modeling is concerned to large corporations,
					also
					students, teachers and scientists need to model some real life situations in order to bring solutions for many
					problems.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 class="super-subtitle">How SystemicWorks is better than existing software?</h2>
		<div class="horizontal">
			<div class="vertical reset-basis">
				<p>
					In particular, there already exist some applications like Vensim® or STELLA® that give access to the software with
					an
					educative license. Despite this, those applications have two main problems. Firstly, the educative license restricts
					the use of the program to "academic purposes", so, for example, if you want to apply what you have learned using the
					PLE (Personal Learning Edition of Vensim®), you must pay the software or depend on a company that can buy that
					software for you. On the other hand, some applications like STELLA® also force you to publish your work with a
					Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License while creating a project.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="vertical reset-basis">
				<h3>It's Free and Open-Source</h3>
				<p>
					The fact that this software is free and open-source means that it is made by the contributions of many people, which
					helps on developing more functionalities and mantaining the code over time. Actually, this project cames from the
					Nicky Case project called Loopy, which is a demostrative web application of how systems dynamics works, so
					SystemicWorks is a more practical use version of it.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold;">
					Therefore, is better to use SystemicWorks when you have not enough money to get a paid software, but want a reliable
					solution to deal with systems modeling, or when you want to learn about systems dynamics without tying yourself to an
					specific software solution.
